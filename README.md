# topology_discovery_V1

main code : execution_generale.py

for running algorithms, you must choose some parameters like :
nbre_sommets_GR : number of nodes in the initial graph G_R
NBRE_GRAPHE : number of graphs to generate
mode_select_noeuds_1 : how to choose node having a negative state (-1)
p_correl : which action to do in the G_R graph
alpha_max : how many time you have to test algorithm in the same graph G_R with some modified edges
